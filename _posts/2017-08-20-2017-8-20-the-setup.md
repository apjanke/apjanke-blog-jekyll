# The Setup 8/20/2017 {#the-setup-8-20-2017}

I&#8217;m a freelance software developer, hobbyist photographer, and computer geek. That means I spend much of my day on the computer, and I spend a lot of time thinking about how to set it up well. This is what I&#8217;ve arrived at in 2017.

I use multiple computers, and have fully committed to that, contrary to [al3x&#8217;s Rules for Computing Happiness](https://al3x.net/2008/09/08/al3xs-rules-for-computing-happiness.html). I have a home desktop, an office desktop, and a few laptops. I&#8217;ve tried to set things up so I can get any of my work done on any of them, and they all feel as same as possible. So I rely heavily on cloud sync for my data, making that a shared, device-independent resource as much as possible. The exception is large media files: my photos and music live on my home desktop, and my movie & media collection lives on my NAS. Basically everything else is in a cloud drive or server-backed storage somewhere.

## The Desk {#the-desk}

Despite what you might think from the photo of my desk, my first concern with my workspace is ergonomics. I&#8217;m sitting at this desk many hours a week, so it&#8217;s important that everything I touch and look at fit me well.

I&#8217;m 6&#8217;4&#8243; with long limbs, which informs my furniture choices.

My home desk is an IKEA Galant desk with adjustable-height legs (the heavy-duty single-pole legs with the bolt stop, not the picnic-table style continuously-adjustable ones). My chair is a Steelcase Leap. My home is lit with Cree LED bulbs in the summer, and GE incandescents in the winter. I have a basic IKEA thingy-holder rack bolted to the underside of the desk, and some headphone holders, but no real cable management in place. It&#8217;s a rat&#8217;s nest under there.

My office desk and chair are whatever WeWork provided. They&#8217;re good enough, and the desk in particular is quite nice.

## The Hardware {#the-hardware}

I prefer Apple hardware and macOS, so all my machines are Macs or iDevices. When I run Windows or Linux, it&#8217;s in a VM or Boot Camp, or on a remote machine.

My home and office desktops are couple-year-old 27&#8243; iMacs, with maxed-out CPUs, RAM, and SSD. This was an easy choice; monitor quality is very important to me, and these are the best consumer displays I&#8217;ve ever seen, and the rest of the hardware is good too. And they Just Work.

I use mechanical keyboards. Currently using FILCO Majestouch Tenkeyless keyboards, with Cherry MX Brown switches at home, and the new Cherry MX &#8220;Silent Red&#8221; switches at the office. They are very nice. For mice, I&#8217;m still using a Microsoft Intellimouse 1.2A; I&#8217;ve never found anything that fits my hand better. Getting the PS/2-to-USB adapter to work in modern OSes keeps getting harder, but it hasn&#8217;t stopped me yet. My mousepad is the sadly-discontinued Razer Kabuto &#8220;mobile&#8221; mousepad.

For laptops, I have:

  * 15&#8243; Mid 2012 MacBook Pro Retina
  * 15&#8243; Mid 2014 MacBook Pro Retina
  * 13&#8243; Late 2016 MacBook Pro (maxed out)

The Mid 2012 rMBP had been my favorite and main laptop up until recently, when I got the little 13&#8243; 2016 MBP. I&#8217;m still not sold on the new low-travel keyboard, but it&#8217;s so nice in every other respect, and so portable, that the 13&#8243; 2016 has become my main laptop.

I keep one of these laptops as a &#8220;hot spare&#8221; in case one of my other machines breaks, and to use for testing restores of my backups.

All the laptops are maxed out for CPU/RAM/SSD. I usually buy maxed-out machines to prolong their life. The one time I didn&#8217;t was earlier this year, when I bought a base model 13&#8243; MacBook, since it was just going to be a &#8220;travel and coffeeshop&#8221; machine. Mistake: I liked it so much I wanted to switch to it as my main development laptop, so had to get rid of it and get a maxed-out one.

I always buy the AppleCare.

I use a NAS at home. I have a Synology DS415+. I&#8217;m quite happy with it overall, but I wish I had ponied up for an 8-bay one. Which sounds ridiculous for a home network, but I&#8217;ve run in to cases where it would have been useful.

I use Tripp-Lite Isobars for surge protectors and power strips.

I avoid Belkin whenever I can.

## The Data and Services {#the-data-and-services}

My personal photo library and music collection sit on the hard drive of my home desktop. All my other long-lived data is backed by a cloud service of some sort.

Pretty much all my data sits in Dropbox, and I have my full Dropbox synced to all my machines. I&#8217;ve been using Dropbox for years, and am happy with it.

I use:

  * Dropbox for general data storage
  * 1Password for passwords
  * FastMail for email hosting
  * Google Chrome login for syncing web bookmarks etc

## The Backups {#the-backups}

For backups, I follow the [&#8220;3-2-1 Rule&#8221;](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/), and then some. I do:

  * Local Time Machine backups to multiple USB external drives, kept at my apartment
  * LAN Time Machine backups to a shared drive on my NAS
  * Cloud backups to Backblaze
  * Secondary cloud backups to Arq Backup

Plus almost all my data is in Dropbox.

I test restores every so often by doing a restore to my standby laptop. It&#8217;s a pain, because that collides with notions of machine identity. I&#8217;m not satisfied with my backup testing situation.

## The Software {#the-software}

I use a bunch of software on my machines. Much of it is installed manually. Command-line stuff is installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

I use:

  * Thunderbird
  * f.lux
  * JustNotes
  * Bartender (for status bar management)
  * Moom (for window management)
  * iTerm2
  * Text Editors: 
      * Sublime Text
      * BBEdit
      * vim
      * Atom 
          * (I wrote this blog post in Atom; it has the best user-friendly Markdown handling.)
  * Browsers: All of Google Chrome, Firefox, Thunderbird, Opera, and TorBrowser
  * IDEs: 
      * Matlab
      * NetBeans
      * All of JetBrains&#8217;s IDEs, including RubyMine, IntelliJ, PyCharm, and DataGrip
      * R, RStudio
  * Atlassian SourceTree
  * VMware Fusion
  * Acorn
  * Aperture (sadly discontinued, so you can only get it if you already purchased it.)
  * Calibre (with my library stored in Dropbox)
  * Microsoft Office
  * &#8230;and a bunch of other stuff&#8230;

And, of course, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). I install it, along with a bunch of &#8220;standard&#8221; packages I&#8217;ve decided on, and switch it in to &#8220;developer mode&#8221;, since I&#8217;m maintainer.

For Thunderbird, I do a full local folder sync and have locally-stored keys and certificates. To get it running on a new machine, I bootstrap it by copying over the profile directory from one of my existing machines.

I also do a bunch of configuration for OS and application settings.

I keep my config files and setup scripts in [a dotfiles repo on GitHub](https://github.com/apjanke/dotfiles), which I clone to all my machines and use to set them up.

My software setup process is partially automated, and I&#8217;m working on getting it even more automated. Maybe I&#8217;ll discuss that in a future post.

Setup on Windows is a whole &#8216;nother story.

## The Audio {#the-audio}

I listen to music on big over-ear headphones driven by external headphone amps. Headphones are kind of my hobby, so at any time, I usually have a few headphones and headphone amps on my desk.

I can&#8217;t tell the difference between any decent DACs, so I just have my headphones setup to use a single DAC (currently a Musical Fidelity V-DAC) feeding in to a cheap passive 8-way RCA switch I found on Amazon, which fans out to the various headphone amps I have going.

My favorite amps are the HeadRoom Ultra Desktop and Schiit Audio Valhalla 2; I doubt they&#8217;ll ever lose their place on my desk. My permanent-rotation headphones are the Denon AH-D7000/Fostex TH900, Beyerdynamic DT-990 250 ohm, and Sony MDR-7506.

My main room speaker is an old Logitech Pure-Fi Elite, which is still my favorite iPod dock. (I had a Peachtree Deepblue2, but it was too loud and bassy for my Brooklyn apartment.) And I still use my old spinning-rust iPods as my main music player.

## The Miscellaneous {#the-miscellaneous}

Some other of my favorite things to keep on my desk:

A Gerber Paraframe folding knife.

Muji rollerball pens.

Trader Joe&#8217;s coffee.
